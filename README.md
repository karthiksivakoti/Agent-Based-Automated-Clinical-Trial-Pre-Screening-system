## üåü Overview

Clinical trial recruitment is a critical bottleneck in medical research, with patient screening being particularly time-consuming and resource-intensive. This project demonstrates an agent-based approach to automate the pre-screening process, combining structured data analysis with LLM-powered natural language processing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="Rationale_Eligible_Trial_Cardio_01.png" alt="Patient Eligibility Example" width="600"/>
  <br>
  <em>Transparent Eligibility Assessment with Criterion-Level Explainability</em>
</p>

Our system delivers:

- **Complete transparency**: Every eligibility decision includes detailed criterion-by-criterion rationales
- **Hybrid intelligence**: Combines rule-based logic with LLM capabilities for comprehensive assessment
- **Clinical trust**: Physicians can verify exactly why patients are deemed eligible or ineligible
- **Efficient screening**: Automatically retrieves and processes patient data from electronic health records
- **Unparalleled explainability**: No "black box" decisions‚Äîeach result shows the exact reasoning path

By automating this labor-intensive process while maintaining full transparency, our system has the potential to significantly accelerate trial recruitment while enhancing clinical confidence in the screening results.


## üîç The Challenge

<p align="center">
  <img src="Clinical_trial_bottleneck.png" alt="Clinical Trial Recruitment Bottleneck" width="600"/>
</p>

Clinical trial recruitment faces significant challenges:

- Manual screening of EHRs is labor-intensive and error-prone
- Complex eligibility criteria spanning structured and unstructured data
- Critical information often buried in clinical notes
- Heterogeneous data formats across clinical systems
- High costs and delays associated with recruitment failures

### AI Explainability

A key strength of our system is its ability to provide detailed, transparent rationales for every eligibility decision. This explainability is critical for clinical applications where understanding the "why" behind recommendations is as important as the recommendations themselves.

For each patient, the system generates a comprehensive breakdown showing:
- The final eligibility assessment
- Each criterion that was evaluated
- Whether the patient passed or failed each specific criterion
- The exact reason for each decision

</td>

These detailed rationales provide several benefits:

- **Clinical Trust**: Physicians and clinical trial coordinators can verify the accuracy of screening decisions
- **Process Transparency**: The decision path is fully visible, not a "black box" algorithm
- **Error Detection**: Inconsistencies or data quality issues become immediately apparent
- **Educational Value**: The system demonstrates how specific criteria impact eligibility
- **Audit Trail**: Decisions can be reviewed and validated during regulatory inspection

The system effectively processes both structured criteria (age, lab values, diagnosis codes) and makes reasonable assessments of natural language criteria when sufficient information is available in clinical notes. By clearly labeling uncertain determinations, the system acknowledges its limitations and identifies cases requiring human review.

This approach to explainable AI is essential for clinical applications where automated systems must augment rather than replace human decision-making, ensuring that technology enhances rather than obscures the recruitment process.
## üß† LLM Integration

The system leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o to:

- Interpret natural language eligibility criteria
- Extract relevant information from clinical notes
- Make reasoned judgments based on available evidence
- Indicate uncertainty when information is insufficient

Example natural language criteria:
- "Patient is documented as a non-smoker or former smoker"
- "Patient has participated in another investigational drug trial within the last 30 days"

## üî¨ Sample Trials

The system was tested with simplified protocols:
