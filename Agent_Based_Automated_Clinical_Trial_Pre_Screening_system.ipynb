The patient received a stress test as part\\nof a risk stratification workup and at no point demonstrated\\nany evidence of chest pain.  A subsequent exercise MIBI study\\nperformed [**2183-3-28**] revealed an exercise capacity of\\nonly 2 minutes 15 seconds on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.  There was\\nno chest pain noted on the test and the peak exercise\\nelectrocardiogram showed 1.5 to 2 mm horizontal to upsloping\\nST depression in the inferior leads and in V1 and V2.\\nImaging studies revealed a large apical to a small anterior\\ndefect that was reversible.  The patient's ejection fraction\\nwas noted to be 56% with normal wall motion.  The patient\\nsubsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2183-4-22**] which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease\\nand mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  The patient was\\nthereafter referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] for surgical\\nevaluation and was subsequently scheduled for a coronary\\nartery bypass graft on [**2183-4-28**].\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2183-4-28**], the patient underwent a\\ncoronary artery bypass graft times three with grafts from the\\nleft internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,\\nsaphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and\\nsaphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  The patient\\ntolerated the procedure well.  The patient's pericardium was\\nleft open.

The patient was subsequently transferred to\\nthe Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further\\nevaluation and management.  Shortly after arriving in the\\nCardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was easily weaned\\nand extubated without complication.  On postoperative day #1,\\nthe patient was noted to be stable for transfer to the floor\\nand was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service\\nunder the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  The patient's\\npostoperative course was uneventful and she progressed well\\nclinically.  On postoperative day #1, the patient's chest\\ntube and Foley catheter were successfully removed without\\ncomplications.  Follow up chest x-ray demonstrated no\\nevidence of pneumothorax, and the patient was noted to be\\nindependently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the\\nduration of her stay.

[**Last Name (STitle) 9974**] ON [**2134-9-21**]..\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n1. Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by\\nfall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.\\nElectrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2,\\nand started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po,\\nwith a dosing schedule of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week, followed by\\n400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT\\nthought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from\\nprevious MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given\\nthe pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons,\\nand given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat\\nhis arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was\\nprolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient\\nremained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.\\n2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease,\\nsubsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and\\nIABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able\\nto maintain his own pressure.\\nEcho completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with\\nseverely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially\\nstarted on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had\\nanother episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history\\nof melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was\\nthought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.\\nThe patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker,\\nand was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an\\noutpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without\\ncomplications.\\n3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO\\nHe was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction\\nand an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his\\nkidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose\\nlisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also\\nunderwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.\\n4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive\\nnephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V\\ngraft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once\\ngraft accessible.  On [**9-22**], graft noted to be difficult to\\naccess per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and\\nsuccessful angioplasty was performed.\\n5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for\\nsuspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently\\nelevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was\\npositive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a\\nrepeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient\\nstarted on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures\\npending at time of discharge, no growth to date.\\n6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic\\nrenal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee\\nground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed,\\nand patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above\\n30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron\\nsupplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in\\naddition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis\\n7. DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent\\nhyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale\\nwith Accu-Check to monitor.\\n8. Psych: Patient was continued on his home dose of Zoloft 100\\nmg once daily.\\nPatient tolerated a low Na/cardiac healthy diet and was placed\\non a PPI for GI prophylaxis.\\nPatient was discharged to rehab facility with plan to follow up\\nwith cardiology and PCP within the next month.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n.

Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by\\nfall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.\\nElectrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2,\\nand started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po,\\nwith a dosing schedule of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week, followed by\\n400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT\\nthought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from\\nprevious MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given\\nthe pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons,\\nand given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat\\nhis arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was\\nprolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient\\nremained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.\\n2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease,\\nsubsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and\\nIABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able\\nto maintain his own pressure.\\nEcho completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with\\nseverely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially\\nstarted on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had\\nanother episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history\\nof melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was\\nthought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.\\nThe patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker,\\nand was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an\\noutpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without\\ncomplications.\\n3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO\\nHe was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction\\nand an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his\\nkidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose\\nlisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also\\nunderwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.\\n4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive\\nnephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V\\ngraft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once\\ngraft accessible.  On [**9-22**], graft noted to be difficult to\\naccess per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and\\nsuccessful angioplasty was performed.\\n5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for\\nsuspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently\\nelevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was\\npositive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a\\nrepeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient\\nstarted on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures\\npending at time of discharge, no growth to date.\\n6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic\\nrenal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee\\nground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed,\\nand patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above\\n30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron\\nsupplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in\\naddition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis\\n7.

He was started on decadron 1mg [**Hospital1 **].\\nPt was scheduled for resection with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2157-10-22**].\\nHowever last night he was moving furniture, and upon moving a\\nbureau back into his home he developed a sensation of numbness\\nat his foot that travelled to his upper thigh over the course of\\nonly a few seconds. He then noted rhythmic low amplitude shaking\\nof the limb that was not suppressable. His right arm then\\nextended outwards beyond his volitional control. His wife took\\nhim to [**Hospital3 417**] where he was given ativan IV, loaded with\\nFosphenytoin 1,000mg IV. The movements subsided in about 15\\nminutes. No loss of consciousness. No speech/language deficits.\\nNo visual loss. He reports no further episodes since. Currently\\nfeeling well. Denies any headaches. He does still feel a loss of\\nsensation in a stocking distribution of his right foot to his\\nankle. When he walks he feels like he does not have command over\\nhis right leg.

He denies alcohol use.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  Shellfish and IV dye, which causes hives, and\\namiodarone which caused edema.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate of\\n80, blood pressure 86/52, respiratory rate 16.  Saturating\\n97% on room air.  Patient was alert and oriented times three\\nin no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  Pupils are equal,\\nround, and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.  There was\\nno JVD and no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular reveals\\nregular, rate, and rhythm with occasional irregular beats.\\nFaint systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal\\nborder.  Respiratory:  Lungs are clear to auscultation\\nbilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.\\nExtremities revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema.\\n\\nSUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1. Cardiac rhythm:  Patient is admitted with multiple shocks\\nfrom his ICD.  The shocks had occurred when the patient was\\nusing his left arm predominantly.  This is likely due to the\\nfact that there was a device malfunction.  The device was\\ninterrogated, and found to be oversensing noise from certain\\narm movements.  The device was turned off and programmed DDD.\\nThe INR was 2.5, so the patient was given vitamin K with plan\\nfor future need revision.\\n\\nOvernight the patient had a four-second pause on telemetry,\\nalthough the patient was asymptomatic.  The patient returned\\nto the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a pacing catheter\\nplaced.  The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2126-5-7**] for further monitoring in the setting of transvenous\\npacing.  The patient remained comfortable and when his INR\\ntrended down, he returned to the EP Laboratory for device\\nrevision and lead revision.  Patient tolerated the procedure\\nwell.\\n\\nAfter this, the patient returned to the [**Hospital3 **]\\nfloors and received multiple shocks on the morning, which\\nwere appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  The patient's\\npacemaker was interrogated and found to be functioning well.\\nIt was reprogrammed to over pace out of ventricular\\ntachycardia prior to shocking.  The patient had additional\\nepisodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were successfully\\npaced out of by his pacemaker.  Patient was started on\\nlidocaine drip given his significant ventricular tachycardia\\nand the episodes of VT diminished significantly.  The patient\\nwas transitioned to mexiletine on the next day, and tolerated\\nthis well.  The patient had no further episodes of\\nsignificant ventricular tachycardia.\\n\\n2. Coronary artery disease:  The patient currently had no\\nsymptoms.  He was continued on his Plavix, statin,\\nbeta-blocker, and Imdur.  Patient was not admitted on an\\naspirin, although he was given an aspirin during his\\nhospitalization given the fact that was Coumadin was held.\\nPlan for no aspirin on discharge with resuming his Coumadin\\nas per his prior home regimen.\\n\\n3. Congestive heart failure:  Patient has an ischemic\\ncardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.\\nAn echocardiogram on this hospitalization again revealed an\\nejection fraction of 15-20%.  While the patient was NPO\\nduring episodes of this hospitalization, his Lasix and\\naldactone was held; however, he was continued on his Lasix,\\naldactone, digoxin, and ACE inhibitor.  Patient had no\\nevidence of congestive heart failure during this\\nhospitalization and he resumed his prior medications before\\ndischarge.\\n\\n4. Endocrine:  Patient with hypothyroidism:  The patient was\\ncontinued on his Levoxyl.  He was also maintained on a\\nregular insulin-sliding scale.  Blood sugars remained in\\nnormal levels, and he did not require significant amounts of\\ninsulin.\\n\\n5. Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency.\\nRemained stable throughout this hospitalization.\\n\\n6. Heme:  Patient's INR was reversed with vitamin K, and the\\npatient was instructed to resume Coumadin dosing on the\\nevening following discharge.  The patient will follow up with\\nhis cardiologist or primary care physician for further\\nmonitoring of his INR and adjustment of his Coumadin dose.\\n\\n7. ID:  The patient had a temperature greater than 101.5\\nfollowing his pacemaker placement, and therefore was\\ncontinued on his cephalosporin, which was originally given\\nfor prophylaxis.  The patient was transitioned to p.o.\\nantibiotics, plan for seven-day course.\\n\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1. ICD firing.\\n2.

He denies alcohol use.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  Shellfish and IV dye, which causes hives, and\\namiodarone which caused edema.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate of\\n80, blood pressure 86/52, respiratory rate 16.  Saturating\\n97% on room air.  Patient was alert and oriented times three\\nin no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  Pupils are equal,\\nround, and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.  There was\\nno JVD and no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular reveals\\nregular, rate, and rhythm with occasional irregular beats.\\nFaint systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal\\nborder.  Respiratory:  Lungs are clear to auscultation\\nbilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.\\nExtremities revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema.\\n\\nSUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\\n1. Cardiac rhythm:  Patient is admitted with multiple shocks\\nfrom his ICD.  The shocks had occurred when the patient was\\nusing his left arm predominantly.  This is likely due to the\\nfact that there was a device malfunction.  The device was\\ninterrogated, and found to be oversensing noise from certain\\narm movements.  The device was turned off and programmed DDD.\\nThe INR was 2.5, so the patient was given vitamin K with plan\\nfor future need revision.\\n\\nOvernight the patient had a four-second pause on telemetry,\\nalthough the patient was asymptomatic.  The patient returned\\nto the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a pacing catheter\\nplaced.  The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2126-5-7**] for further monitoring in the setting of transvenous\\npacing.  The patient remained comfortable and when his INR\\ntrended down, he returned to the EP Laboratory for device\\nrevision and lead revision.  Patient tolerated the procedure\\nwell.\\n\\nAfter this, the patient returned to the [**Hospital3 **]\\nfloors and received multiple shocks on the morning, which\\nwere appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  The patient's\\npacemaker was interrogated and found to be functioning well.\\nIt was reprogrammed to over pace out of ventricular\\ntachycardia prior to shocking.  The patient had additional\\nepisodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were successfully\\npaced out of by his pacemaker.  Patient was started on\\nlidocaine drip given his significant ventricular tachycardia\\nand the episodes of VT diminished significantly.  The patient\\nwas transitioned to mexiletine on the next day, and tolerated\\nthis well.  The patient had no further episodes of\\nsignificant ventricular tachycardia.\\n\\n2. Coronary artery disease:  The patient currently had no\\nsymptoms.  He was continued on his Plavix, statin,\\nbeta-blocker, and Imdur.  Patient was not admitted on an\\naspirin, although he was given an aspirin during his\\nhospitalization given the fact that was Coumadin was held.\\nPlan for no aspirin on discharge with resuming his Coumadin\\nas per his prior home regimen.\\n\\n3. Congestive heart failure:  Patient has an ischemic\\ncardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.\\nAn echocardiogram on this hospitalization again revealed an\\nejection fraction of 15-20%.  While the patient was NPO\\nduring episodes of this hospitalization, his Lasix and\\naldactone was held; however, he was continued on his Lasix,\\naldactone, digoxin, and ACE inhibitor.  Patient had no\\nevidence of congestive heart failure during this\\nhospitalization and he resumed his prior medications before\\ndischarge.\\n\\n4. Endocrine:  Patient with hypothyroidism:  The patient was\\ncontinued on his Levoxyl.  He was also maintained on a\\nregular insulin-sliding scale.  Blood sugars remained in\\nnormal levels, and he did not require significant amounts of\\ninsulin.\\n\\n5. Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency.\\nRemained stable throughout this hospitalization.\\n\\n6. Heme:  Patient's INR was reversed with vitamin K, and the\\npatient was instructed to resume Coumadin dosing on the\\nevening following discharge.  The patient will follow up with\\nhis cardiologist or primary care physician for further\\nmonitoring of his INR and adjustment of his Coumadin dose.\\n\\n7. ID:  The patient had a temperature greater than 101.5\\nfollowing his pacemaker placement, and therefore was\\ncontinued on his cephalosporin, which was originally given\\nfor prophylaxis.  The patient was transitioned to p.o.\\nantibiotics, plan for seven-day course.\\n\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1. ICD firing.\\n2.

The patient had\\nevidence of unresectable pancreatic cancer with biliary\\nobstruction seen intraoperatively.  Adhesiolysis was\\ntherefore performed along with a Roux-en-Y\\nhepaticojejunostomy, and open cholecystectomy, an open\\npancreatic biopsy, and a gastrojejunostomy.  The estimated\\nblood loss for the procedure was 250 cc.\\n\\nThe patient was discharged to the regular hospital floor\\nafter being extubated in the Postanesthesia Care Unit in good\\ncondition.\\n\\nIn the evening on postoperative day one, the patient was\\ntaken back to the operating room emergently for likely\\nmesenteric bleeding.  This was controlled with suture\\nligation, and the patient was admitted to the Surgical\\nIntensive Care Unit postoperatively for close monitoring.\\nThe patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit on\\npressor support and received total parenteral nutrition until\\npostoperative day seven.  At this time, the patient's mental\\nstatus was extremely labile requiring Haldol for agitation.\\nThe patient's hematocrit was stable at 35.8 at this time.\\n\\nTube feeds were initiated on postoperative day eight.  On\\npostoperative day nine, the patient was transferred to the\\nregular hospital floor.  At this time, tube feeds were held\\nfor elevated residuals and nausea.  He was still receiving\\ntotal parenteral nutrition at this time.  The patient's\\nmental status was still not completely improved.  A computed\\ntomography scan was performed on postoperative day ten which\\ndid not demonstrate any intra-abdominal pathology.\\n\\nThe patient was started on sips on postoperative day eleven\\nand was started on his home medications.  At this time, he\\nwas seen by the Physical Therapy Service and was being\\nscreened for rehabilitation placement.\\n\\nHowever, on the evening on postoperative day twelve the\\npatient spiked a temperature to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.  A\\nfever workup was done including a chest x-ray and blood\\ncultures.\\n\\nEarly the next morning, the patient was found unresponsive\\nwithout a pulse at approximately 2:45 a.m.  At this time, a\\ncode blue was called and advanced cardiac life support\\nprotocol was initiated.  However, the patient was asystolic\\nwithout any respiratory effort at this time.  He did receive\\nmultiple rounds of epinephrine along with attempts at\\nventilation.

No PE.\\nStable trace\\nascites and small right pleural effusion. Unchanged small\\npulmonary nodules\\nand lymphadenopathy in the chest. No acute abnormalities in the\\nabdomen to\\nexplain epigastric pain.\\n\\nEGD: Ulcer at GE junction.\\n\\n# Hypertensive urgency: This is a chronic issue related to ESRD.\\nHead CT was negative for intracranial bleed. Weaned off\\nNicardipine gtt and BP well controlled on home regimen.\\nContinued her home regimen of: Aliskiren 150 mg po bid,\\nClonidine 0.4 mg/24 hr Patch Weekly, Labetalol 1000 mg po TID,\\nNifedipine 60 mg Tablet Sustained Release QPM and 90 mg Tablet\\nSustained Release QAM, Hydralazine 100 mg PO Q8H. When BPs were\\nlower (see below) patient's BP meds were held occasionally, but\\nas she was transfused and the BPs started to trend back up the\\nmeds were re-initiated. She then developed hypotension in the\\nsetting of poor PO intake during her SBO. BP meds were held and\\nthen re-initiated as the pressure came back up once she was able\\nto eat.\\n\\n# Abdominal pain/UGIB: The patient has chronic abdominal pain\\nwith previous negative workups. At first the pain resolved and\\nshe was continued on her outpatient regimen of: 2-4 mg po\\ndilaudid q4 h as needed.  GI was c/s re: abd pain and rec\\nCTA-abdomen to eval for mesenteric ischemia vs. partial SBO,\\nhowever with ESRD did not initially want to get CTA so KUB was\\nordered. This showed no SBO. They recommended checking urine\\nporphyrobilinogen and serum lead levels which were negative and\\nLFTs were at baseline. The patient then developed a different\\ntype of pain associated with her incision site. Pain service was\\nconsulted and did a bupivicaine injection at the site which did\\nhelp. They will continue to follow her. She then developed a\\nthird type of pain associated with a burning sensation in her\\nchest. EKG was unchanged from prior. A few hours later she had 3\\nepisodes of coffee-ground emesis. She was placed on IV PPI and\\ntransfused two units of blood. Afterward the pain resolved and\\nher hct remained stable. GI felt that the patient would need\\ngeneral anesthesia in order to undergo an EGD which showed an\\nulcer at the GE junction. She was started on empiric treatment\\nfor H. Pylori and serologies were sent which came back negative\\nso the antibiotics were stopped. Her pain was controlled with\\nher outpatient regimen of PO dilaudid. She will follow up with\\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**6-18**] weeks to have another EGD under MAC to see if\\nthere has been resolution of the ulcer.\\n\\n# SBO: Continued to be nauseous and vomited intermittently. she\\nwas started on reglan and continued on zofran and compazine PRN\\nhoweve she continued to have n/v. A KUB was done which showed an\\nSBO. Surgery was consulted, NGT was placed, she was made NPO and\\nserial abdominal exams were done. Eventually she was able to\\ntransition to clear diet and then tolerated a regular diet\\nwithout pain or vomiting.\\n\\n#. Fever: On hospital day #6 she spiked a fever to 101. Blood\\nand urine cultures were sent and a cxr were negative, however\\nshe then had a seizure and in the post-ictal state aspirated\\nafter vomiting. She had an episode of hypoxia with this and was\\ntransferred to the ICU. In the ICU LP was attempted to rule out\\nmeningitis as a possible cause of a seizure but this was\\nunsuccessful. Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated (vanc\\nctx) at meningeal dosing. She improved over the next few days\\nand antibiotics were discontinued because the suspicion for a\\nbacterial meningitis was low.\\n\\n#. Seizure: This occured in the setting of fever, hypotension,\\nand initiation of reglan for vomiting. Neurology was consulted\\nand felt she should be continued on keppra indefinitely. EEG was\\nnon-revealing. She should be continued on keppra 1gm with\\ndialysis three times weekly.\\n\\n# ESRD on HD: Hyperkalemia resolved with kayexalate. Underwent\\ndialysis on normal schedule.\\n\\n# SLE: She was continued on prednisone 4mg daily. With multiple\\nabdominal symptoms it was thought she may have lupus flare in\\nthe abdomen. C3, c4 were equivocal for active lupus flare, and\\n[**Doctor First Name **] was positive, as would be expected in lupus.\\n\\n# Anemia: Has anemia of chronic renal disease and her Hct was\\nhigh on admission and epo was held per renal. However, her Hct\\ntrended all the way down to 20 and she was borderline\\nhypotensive for her (ie SBP 120) and she developed coffee ground\\nemesis so she was transfused 2 units. Afterward her Hct was\\nstable at 25. She was also re-started on EPO per renal for her\\nchronic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative.\\n\\n# History of thrombotic events/SVC syndrome: She is\\nanticoagulated with warfarin as an outpatient. Previous\\ndocumentation in OMR states she does not need to be bridged\\nwhile subtherapeutic.  Continued coumadin 4 mg po daily however\\nINR became supratherapeutic and the coumadin was then held. She\\nwas started on heparin gtt while awaiting EGD. After EGD the\\ncoumadin was re-started at 3mg daily however, in setting of poor\\npo intake her INR was supratherapeutic - likely [**2-12**] nutritional\\ndeficiency of vitamin k. coumadin will be restarted when INR [**2-13**]\\nat dialysis.\\n\\n# OSA: She is on CPAP at a setting of 7 as an outpatient.\\nContinued CPAP\\n\\n#. CIN1: On last pap had CIN1. OB/GYN service was called re:\\ndoing colposcopy in hospital as patient rarely makes o/p\\nappointments, hwoever they do not do this procedure in hospital\\nespecially because it does not have to be done emergently - just\\nwithin one year. Will need outpatient colposcopy at some point\\nin next few months as they do not do this procedure in the\\nhospital.\\n\\n# RLL nodule:  A new 10 x 5 mm nodularity was found incidentally\\nwithin the right lower lobe of the lung on an abdominal CT.\\nThis should be reassessed in 3 months.\\n\\n# ACCESS: PIV, right groin HD line\\n# CODE: Full code\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n1.

No PE.\\nStable trace\\nascites and small right pleural effusion. Unchanged small\\npulmonary nodules\\nand lymphadenopathy in the chest. No acute abnormalities in the\\nabdomen to\\nexplain epigastric pain.\\n\\nEGD: Ulcer at GE junction.\\n\\n# Hypertensive urgency: This is a chronic issue related to ESRD.\\nHead CT was negative for intracranial bleed. Weaned off\\nNicardipine gtt and BP well controlled on home regimen.\\nContinued her home regimen of: Aliskiren 150 mg po bid,\\nClonidine 0.4 mg/24 hr Patch Weekly, Labetalol 1000 mg po TID,\\nNifedipine 60 mg Tablet Sustained Release QPM and 90 mg Tablet\\nSustained Release QAM, Hydralazine 100 mg PO Q8H. When BPs were\\nlower (see below) patient's BP meds were held occasionally, but\\nas she was transfused and the BPs started to trend back up the\\nmeds were re-initiated. She then developed hypotension in the\\nsetting of poor PO intake during her SBO. BP meds were held and\\nthen re-initiated as the pressure came back up once she was able\\nto eat.\\n\\n# Abdominal pain/UGIB: The patient has chronic abdominal pain\\nwith previous negative workups. At first the pain resolved and\\nshe was continued on her outpatient regimen of: 2-4 mg po\\ndilaudid q4 h as needed.  GI was c/s re: abd pain and rec\\nCTA-abdomen to eval for mesenteric ischemia vs. partial SBO,\\nhowever with ESRD did not initially want to get CTA so KUB was\\nordered. This showed no SBO. They recommended checking urine\\nporphyrobilinogen and serum lead levels which were negative and\\nLFTs were at baseline. The patient then developed a different\\ntype of pain associated with her incision site. Pain service was\\nconsulted and did a bupivicaine injection at the site which did\\nhelp. They will continue to follow her. She then developed a\\nthird type of pain associated with a burning sensation in her\\nchest. EKG was unchanged from prior. A few hours later she had 3\\nepisodes of coffee-ground emesis. She was placed on IV PPI and\\ntransfused two units of blood. Afterward the pain resolved and\\nher hct remained stable. GI felt that the patient would need\\ngeneral anesthesia in order to undergo an EGD which showed an\\nulcer at the GE junction. She was started on empiric treatment\\nfor H. Pylori and serologies were sent which came back negative\\nso the antibiotics were stopped. Her pain was controlled with\\nher outpatient regimen of PO dilaudid. She will follow up with\\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**6-18**] weeks to have another EGD under MAC to see if\\nthere has been resolution of the ulcer.\\n\\n# SBO: Continued to be nauseous and vomited intermittently. she\\nwas started on reglan and continued on zofran and compazine PRN\\nhoweve she continued to have n/v. A KUB was done which showed an\\nSBO. Surgery was consulted, NGT was placed, she was made NPO and\\nserial abdominal exams were done. Eventually she was able to\\ntransition to clear diet and then tolerated a regular diet\\nwithout pain or vomiting.\\n\\n#. Fever: On hospital day #6 she spiked a fever to 101. Blood\\nand urine cultures were sent and a cxr were negative, however\\nshe then had a seizure and in the post-ictal state aspirated\\nafter vomiting. She had an episode of hypoxia with this and was\\ntransferred to the ICU. In the ICU LP was attempted to rule out\\nmeningitis as a possible cause of a seizure but this was\\nunsuccessful. Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated (vanc\\nctx) at meningeal dosing. She improved over the next few days\\nand antibiotics were discontinued because the suspicion for a\\nbacterial meningitis was low.\\n\\n#. Seizure: This occured in the setting of fever, hypotension,\\nand initiation of reglan for vomiting. Neurology was consulted\\nand felt she should be continued on keppra indefinitely. EEG was\\nnon-revealing. She should be continued on keppra 1gm with\\ndialysis three times weekly.\\n\\n# ESRD on HD: Hyperkalemia resolved with kayexalate. Underwent\\ndialysis on normal schedule.\\n\\n# SLE: She was continued on prednisone 4mg daily. With multiple\\nabdominal symptoms it was thought she may have lupus flare in\\nthe abdomen. C3, c4 were equivocal for active lupus flare, and\\n[**Doctor First Name **] was positive, as would be expected in lupus.\\n\\n# Anemia: Has anemia of chronic renal disease and her Hct was\\nhigh on admission and epo was held per renal. However, her Hct\\ntrended all the way down to 20 and she was borderline\\nhypotensive for her (ie SBP 120) and she developed coffee ground\\nemesis so she was transfused 2 units. Afterward her Hct was\\nstable at 25. She was also re-started on EPO per renal for her\\nchronic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative.\\n\\n# History of thrombotic events/SVC syndrome: She is\\nanticoagulated with warfarin as an outpatient. Previous\\ndocumentation in OMR states she does not need to be bridged\\nwhile subtherapeutic.  Continued coumadin 4 mg po daily however\\nINR became supratherapeutic and the coumadin was then held. She\\nwas started on heparin gtt while awaiting EGD. After EGD the\\ncoumadin was re-started at 3mg daily however, in setting of poor\\npo intake her INR was supratherapeutic - likely [**2-12**] nutritional\\ndeficiency of vitamin k. coumadin will be restarted when INR [**2-13**]\\nat dialysis.\\n\\n# OSA: She is on CPAP at a setting of 7 as an outpatient.\\nContinued CPAP\\n\\n#. CIN1: On last pap had CIN1. OB/GYN service was called re:\\ndoing colposcopy in hospital as patient rarely makes o/p\\nappointments, hwoever they do not do this procedure in hospital\\nespecially because it does not have to be done emergently - just\\nwithin one year. Will need outpatient colposcopy at some point\\nin next few months as they do not do this procedure in the\\nhospital.\\n\\n# RLL nodule:  A new 10 x 5 mm nodularity was found incidentally\\nwithin the right lower lobe of the lung on an abdominal CT.\\nThis should be reassessed in 3 months.\\n\\n# ACCESS: PIV, right groin HD line\\n# CODE: Full code\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\n1.

Patient had been seen earlier in the\\nweek and started on Zithromax for presumed respiratory\\ninfection.  However, he returned on the day prior to\\nadmission with recurrent cough.  CTA done at that time showed\\na partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm or penetrating ulcer of\\nthe aortic arch approximately 2.5 cm distal to the takeoff of\\nthe left subclavian artery with diffuse emphysematous\\nchanges, no pulmonary embolus.\\n\\nHe was started on esmolol for blood pressure control, given\\nan elevated pressure of 175/48 when he was admitted.  He had\\nappropriate monitoring placed including an A line and a Foley\\ncatheter, and admission laboratories were significant for a\\nhematocrit of 41.4 and a BUN and creatinine of 26 and 1.4.\\nHis EKG did not show ischemic changes and his CK's and\\ntroponins were negative initially.  Vascular Surgery and\\nCardiothoracic Surgery services were consulted and he was\\nadmitted to the Intensive Care Unit on the Vascular Surgery\\nservice.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right cerebrovascular accident.\\n\\nCoronary artery disease.\\n\\nHypertension.\\n\\nProstate cancer.\\n\\nHistory of hepatitis C.\\n\\nHypercholesterolemia.\\n\\nHypertension.\\n\\nAsthma.\\n\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Left carotid endarterectomy in [**2161-8-16**].\\n\\nRight carotid endarterectomy in [**2161-6-16**].\\n\\nFive vessel CABG in [**2152**].\\n\\nRight upper lobectomy for lung cancer in [**2154**].\\n\\nLeft vertebral artery stent in [**2161-6-16**].\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n1. Albuterol.\\n2. [**Doctor First Name **].\\n3. Lipitor 20 mg by mouth every day.\\n4. Cartia XT 300 mg by mouth every day.\\n5. Ecotrin 325 mg by mouth every day.\\n6. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg by mouth every day.\\n7. Protonix 40 mg by mouth every day.\\n8. Serevent every day.\\n\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker.  He quit in\\n[**2160-5-15**] with a greater than 30 pack year history.  Denies\\ningestion of alcohol.\\n\\nINITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.9, heart rate\\n64, blood pressure initially 131/73 down to 110/57 after\\ninstitution of esmolol, 93 percent.  He was alert and in no\\nacute distress.  His heart was regular with no murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops.  His chest was clear to auscultation with\\ndiminished breath sounds in the bases.  His abdomen was\\nmoderately obese with normoactive bowel sounds, soft, and\\nnontender.  Extremities were warm without clubbing, cyanosis,\\nor edema.  He had palpable femoral pulses bilaterally and\\nDopplerable popliteal, DP and PT bilaterally with monophasic\\nDP and PT on the left.\\n\\nSTUDIES:  CTA:  No pulmonary embolus.  A 3 cm partially\\nthrombosed pseudoaneurysm versus penetrating ulcer of aortic\\narch 2.5 cm distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian\\nartery, diffuse emphysematous changes.\\n\\nChest x-ray:  No new infiltrate.\\n\\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated above, Mr. [**Known lastname 13029**] was\\nadmitted to the ICU for blood pressure control on an esmolol\\ndrip.  He remained without recurrent chest pain and he had a\\nMRI/MRA done of his chest to further delineate his anatomy.\\nOf note, there were two small outpouchings of contrast from\\nthe lumen of the inferior portion of the aortic arch\\nsurrounded by large thrombus component with some thickening\\nof the aortic wall and no evidence of active bleeding or free\\nfluid.  There were additionally multiple irregularities in\\nthe aortic wall throughout the entire thoracic and abdominal\\naorta that was visualized.  This was thought to represent an\\nunusual appearance of a penetrating ulcer with a large\\nthrombus component.\\n\\nHe additionally had a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for\\nany underlying coronary artery disease should he need\\noperative repair.  This revealed 90 percent stenosis of his\\nright coronary artery, saphenous vein graft with patent vein\\ngrafts to the OM and patent LIMA to the LAD with diffuse\\ndisease in the distal LAD.  A Heparin-coated stent was placed\\nin the vein graft to the right coronary artery.\\n\\nOther findings from his catheterization revealed an 80\\npercent instent stenosis of the left vertebral artery and an\\n80 percent right brachiocephalic ostial lesion.  He tolerated\\nthe procedure well and there were no bleeding or groin\\ncomplications.  He returned to the Intensive Care Unit for\\ncontinued blood pressure monitoring and his esmolol drip was\\neventually weaned off.\\n\\nGiven the patient's multiple medical problems including his\\nsevere pulmonary disease, underlying coronary artery disease,\\nand overall debilitated condition, the decision was made to\\nproceed with medical management as the postoperative\\nmanagement of this likely penetrating ulcer.  He was\\ntransitioned to oral agents.  His diltiazem dose was\\nincreased and Lopressor was added for additional rate\\ncontrol.  He remained off drips for greater than 48 hours.\\nDecision was made to send him home with close followup.  Of\\nnote, his hematocrit remained stable.  His creatinine\\nremained within its baseline of around 1.4 and he was\\ntolerating a regular diet and able to ambulate without\\ndifficulty.\\n\\nOf note, because of his complaint of cough, a sputum sample\\nwas sent, which grew out Pseudomonas that was [**Last Name (LF) 7384**],\\n[**First Name3 (LF) **] he was started on ciprofloxacin on [**2161-12-22**].\\nFollow-up chest x-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe changes\\nconcerning for pneumonia.  He remained afebrile with normal\\nwhite count.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Penetrating ulcer versus thrombosed\\npseudoaneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta.\\n\\nCoronary artery disease status post right coronary artery\\nsaphenous vein graft stent with Heparin-coated stent.\\n\\nBilateral lower lobe pneumonia.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.

Patient had been seen earlier in the\\nweek and started on Zithromax for presumed respiratory\\ninfection.  However, he returned on the day prior to\\nadmission with recurrent cough.  CTA done at that time showed\\na partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm or penetrating ulcer of\\nthe aortic arch approximately 2.5 cm distal to the takeoff of\\nthe left subclavian artery with diffuse emphysematous\\nchanges, no pulmonary embolus.\\n\\nHe was started on esmolol for blood pressure control, given\\nan elevated pressure of 175/48 when he was admitted.  He had\\nappropriate monitoring placed including an A line and a Foley\\ncatheter, and admission laboratories were significant for a\\nhematocrit of 41.4 and a BUN and creatinine of 26 and 1.4.\\nHis EKG did not show ischemic changes and his CK's and\\ntroponins were negative initially.  Vascular Surgery and\\nCardiothoracic Surgery services were consulted and he was\\nadmitted to the Intensive Care Unit on the Vascular Surgery\\nservice.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right cerebrovascular accident.\\n\\nCoronary artery disease.\\n\\nHypertension.\\n\\nProstate cancer.\\n\\nHistory of hepatitis C.\\n\\nHypercholesterolemia.\\n\\nHypertension.\\n\\nAsthma.\\n\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Left carotid endarterectomy in [**2161-8-16**].\\n\\nRight carotid endarterectomy in [**2161-6-16**].\\n\\nFive vessel CABG in [**2152**].\\n\\nRight upper lobectomy for lung cancer in [**2154**].\\n\\nLeft vertebral artery stent in [**2161-6-16**].\\n\\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n1. Albuterol.\\n2. [**Doctor First Name **].\\n3. Lipitor 20 mg by mouth every day.\\n4. Cartia XT 300 mg by mouth every day.\\n5. Ecotrin 325 mg by mouth every day.\\n6. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg by mouth every day.\\n7. Protonix 40 mg by mouth every day.\\n8. Serevent every day.\\n\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker.  He quit in\\n[**2160-5-15**] with a greater than 30 pack year history.  Denies\\ningestion of alcohol.\\n\\nINITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.9, heart rate\\n64, blood pressure initially 131/73 down to 110/57 after\\ninstitution of esmolol, 93 percent.  He was alert and in no\\nacute distress.  His heart was regular with no murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops.  His chest was clear to auscultation with\\ndiminished breath sounds in the bases.  His abdomen was\\nmoderately obese with normoactive bowel sounds, soft, and\\nnontender.  Extremities were warm without clubbing, cyanosis,\\nor edema.  He had palpable femoral pulses bilaterally and\\nDopplerable popliteal, DP and PT bilaterally with monophasic\\nDP and PT on the left.\\n\\nSTUDIES:  CTA:  No pulmonary embolus.  A 3 cm partially\\nthrombosed pseudoaneurysm versus penetrating ulcer of aortic\\narch 2.5 cm distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian\\nartery, diffuse emphysematous changes.\\n\\nChest x-ray:  No new infiltrate.\\n\\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated above, Mr. [**Known lastname 13029**] was\\nadmitted to the ICU for blood pressure control on an esmolol\\ndrip.  He remained without recurrent chest pain and he had a\\nMRI/MRA done of his chest to further delineate his anatomy.\\nOf note, there were two small outpouchings of contrast from\\nthe lumen of the inferior portion of the aortic arch\\nsurrounded by large thrombus component with some thickening\\nof the aortic wall and no evidence of active bleeding or free\\nfluid.  There were additionally multiple irregularities in\\nthe aortic wall throughout the entire thoracic and abdominal\\naorta that was visualized.  This was thought to represent an\\nunusual appearance of a penetrating ulcer with a large\\nthrombus component.\\n\\nHe additionally had a cardiac catheterization to evaluate for\\nany underlying coronary artery disease should he need\\noperative repair.  This revealed 90 percent stenosis of his\\nright coronary artery, saphenous vein graft with patent vein\\ngrafts to the OM and patent LIMA to the LAD with diffuse\\ndisease in the distal LAD.  A Heparin-coated stent was placed\\nin the vein graft to the right coronary artery.\\n\\nOther findings from his catheterization revealed an 80\\npercent instent stenosis of the left vertebral artery and an\\n80 percent right brachiocephalic ostial lesion.  He tolerated\\nthe procedure well and there were no bleeding or groin\\ncomplications.  He returned to the Intensive Care Unit for\\ncontinued blood pressure monitoring and his esmolol drip was\\neventually weaned off.\\n\\nGiven the patient's multiple medical problems including his\\nsevere pulmonary disease, underlying coronary artery disease,\\nand overall debilitated condition, the decision was made to\\nproceed with medical management as the postoperative\\nmanagement of this likely penetrating ulcer.  He was\\ntransitioned to oral agents.  His diltiazem dose was\\nincreased and Lopressor was added for additional rate\\ncontrol.  He remained off drips for greater than 48 hours.\\nDecision was made to send him home with close followup.  Of\\nnote, his hematocrit remained stable.  His creatinine\\nremained within its baseline of around 1.4 and he was\\ntolerating a regular diet and able to ambulate without\\ndifficulty.\\n\\nOf note, because of his complaint of cough, a sputum sample\\nwas sent, which grew out Pseudomonas that was [**Last Name (LF) 7384**],\\n[**First Name3 (LF) **] he was started on ciprofloxacin on [**2161-12-22**].\\nFollow-up chest x-ray revealed bilateral lower lobe changes\\nconcerning for pneumonia.

He also described some slight\\nshortness of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.  This\\nepisode of chest pain was not initially relieved with\\nsublingual nitroglycerin and the patient presented to [**Hospital6 18075**].\\n\\nAt [**Hospital6 2561**], the patient was found to have no\\nacute electrocardiogram changes and laboratory investigation\\nshowed a CBC with a white blood cell count of 10.7, a\\nhematocrit of 36.6, a platelet count of 291 and a Chem 7\\nwhich was within normal limits with a BUN of 50 and a\\ncreatinine of 1.9.  His CK, MB and troponin I were noted to\\nbe 64, 2.6 and 0.2.  His second set of enzymes were also\\nnormal.  The patient was admitted and his chest pain was\\ntreated with nitroglycerin and heparin drips.  He was also\\nnoted to have an asymptomatic run of ventricular tachycardia\\nof 27 beats without any hemodynamic compromise.  The patient\\nwas started on a lidocaine infusion at that time.\\n\\nThe patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2172-10-14**] and was taken straight to the\\ncardiac catheterization laboratory.  There, he was found to\\nhave a cardiac output and cardiac index of 3.1 and 1.8\\nrespectively.  His right ventricular end diastolic pressure\\nwas 16 and his pulmonary artery pressures were 48/28 with a\\nmean of 39.  His wedge pressure was noted to be 29 and his\\nmixed venous oxygen saturation was 42.  No left ventricular\\nangiography was done.\\n\\nExamination of the coronary arteries showed a right dominant\\nsystem with a normal left main coronary artery.  There was a\\n99% lesion at the first obtuse marginal artery and a 100%\\nlesion at the second obtuse marginal artery.  His\\nposterolateral ventricular branch was noted to be occluded at\\n30%.  The right coronary artery, which had a previous known\\nocclusion, was not injected.  The patient's saphenous vein\\ngraft to left anterior descending artery stent was found to\\nbe 98% occluded and the patient underwent balloon\\npercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and subsequent\\nbrachytherapy with a residual occlusion of 10%.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any history of tobacco\\nuse.  He consumed alcohol socially and currently lived alone\\nwithout support.  The patient was capable of doing his own\\nshopping, cooking, cleaning and driving.  He did have a\\nhealth care proxy by the name of [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 7049**], who resided\\nat 74 [**Hospital1 36830**]in [**Hospital1 2436**].\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  The family history was noncontributory.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was in no\\napparent distress with vital signs showing a temperature of\\n96.9??????F, a blood pressure of 138/63, a heart rate of 87, a\\nrespiratory rate of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 96% on a\\nnonrebreather mask.  The neurological examination was\\nunremarkable.  The patient was awake, alert and oriented\\ntimes three.  On head and neck examination, the pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were\\nintact.  The oropharynx was moist.\\n\\nOn cardiovascular examination, the patient's jugular venous\\npressure was 8-10 cm above the sternal angle.  He had a\\nnormal S1 and S2 with an S3 and S4.  He did not have any\\naudible murmurs.  The respiratory examination showed diffuse\\ncrackles half way up his chest bilaterally with no wheezes.\\nThe abdominal examination was unremarkable.  The extremities\\nshowed palpable bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses with no\\nedema.  He had a right groin pulmonary artery catheter line\\nin place and his arterial sheath site was clean, dry and\\nintact with no bruit or hematoma.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  The patient's cardiac care unit laboratory\\nvalues showed a white blood cell count of 14,200, hematocrit\\nof 27.6 and platelet count of 211,000.  Chem 7 showed a\\nsodium of 129, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 97, bicarbonate\\nof 18, BUN of 46, creatinine of 2.1 and glucose of 217.  CK\\nwas 555, calcium was 9.0 and magnesium was 1.6.

Coronary artery disease:\\n    a) The patient had coronary artery bypass grafting with a\\nsaphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery,\\na saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery, a\\nsaphenous vein graft to the third obtuse marginal artery and\\na saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.\\n    b) He had re-do coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2170**]\\nwith a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending\\nartery with no bypass grafts to total occlusions of right\\ncoronary artery and obtuse marginal artery grafts.\\n    c) In [**2172-3-5**], the patient had a stent of the\\nsaphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery\\nwith a cardiac catheterization showing a left ventricular end\\ndiastolic pressure of 17, an ejection fraction of 42% and mid\\ninferior akinesis and anterolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.\\n    d) In [**2172-6-2**], the patient had a percutaneous\\ntransluminal coronary angioplasty of a saphenous vein graft\\nto the left anterior descending artery with a left\\nventricular end diastolic pressure of 19.\\n2.  Hypercholesterolemia.\\n3.  Hypertension.\\n4.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of\\n1.9.\\n5.  Hernia repair.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:\\nAspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\\nEnalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\nMetoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\nLipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.\\nAmlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.\\nSublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was doing well post\\npercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2172-6-2**].\\nOn [**2172-10-11**], he developed back pain while sitting.\\nThis involved radiation to his left arm and also some\\nretrosternal chest pain.  He also described some slight\\nshortness of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.  This\\nepisode of chest pain was not initially relieved with\\nsublingual nitroglycerin and the patient presented to [**Hospital6 18075**].\\n\\nAt [**Hospital6 2561**], the patient was found to have no\\nacute electrocardiogram changes and laboratory investigation\\nshowed a CBC with a white blood cell count of 10.7, a\\nhematocrit of 36.6, a platelet count of 291 and a Chem 7\\nwhich was within normal limits with a BUN of 50 and a\\ncreatinine of 1.9.  His CK, MB and troponin I were noted to\\nbe 64, 2.6 and 0.2.  His second set of enzymes were also\\nnormal.  The patient was admitted and his chest pain was\\ntreated with nitroglycerin and heparin drips.  He was also\\nnoted to have an asymptomatic run of ventricular tachycardia\\nof 27 beats without any hemodynamic compromise.  The patient\\nwas started on a lidocaine infusion at that time.\\n\\nThe patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2172-10-14**] and was taken straight to the\\ncardiac catheterization laboratory.  There, he was found to\\nhave a cardiac output and cardiac index of 3.1 and 1.8\\nrespectively.  His right ventricular end diastolic pressure\\nwas 16 and his pulmonary artery pressures were 48/28 with a\\nmean of 39.  His wedge pressure was noted to be 29 and his\\nmixed venous oxygen saturation was 42.  No left ventricular\\nangiography was done.\\n\\nExamination of the coronary arteries showed a right dominant\\nsystem with a normal left main coronary artery.  There was a\\n99% lesion at the first obtuse marginal artery and a 100%\\nlesion at the second obtuse marginal artery.  His\\nposterolateral ventricular branch was noted to be occluded at\\n30%.  The right coronary artery, which had a previous known\\nocclusion, was not injected.  The patient's saphenous vein\\ngraft to left anterior descending artery stent was found to\\nbe 98% occluded and the patient underwent balloon\\npercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and subsequent\\nbrachytherapy with a residual occlusion of 10%.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any history of tobacco\\nuse.  He consumed alcohol socially and currently lived alone\\nwithout support.  The patient was capable of doing his own\\nshopping, cooking, cleaning and driving.  He did have a\\nhealth care proxy by the name of [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 7049**], who resided\\nat 74 [**Hospital1 36830**]in [**Hospital1 2436**].\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  The family history was noncontributory.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was in no\\napparent distress with vital signs showing a temperature of\\n96.9??????F, a blood pressure of 138/63, a heart rate of 87, a\\nrespiratory rate of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 96% on a\\nnonrebreather mask.  The neurological examination was\\nunremarkable.  The patient was awake, alert and oriented\\ntimes three.  On head and neck examination, the pupils were\\nequal and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were\\nintact.  The oropharynx was moist.\\n\\nOn cardiovascular examination, the patient's jugular venous\\npressure was 8-10 cm above the sternal angle.  He had a\\nnormal S1 and S2 with an S3 and S4.  He did not have any\\naudible murmurs.  The respiratory examination showed diffuse\\ncrackles half way up his chest bilaterally with no wheezes.\\nThe abdominal examination was unremarkable.  The extremities\\nshowed palpable bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses with no\\nedema.  He had a right groin pulmonary artery catheter line\\nin place and his arterial sheath site was clean, dry and\\nintact with no bruit or hematoma.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  The patient's cardiac care unit laboratory\\nvalues showed a white blood cell count of 14,200, hematocrit\\nof 27.6 and platelet count of 211,000.  Chem 7 showed a\\nsodium of 129, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 97, bicarbonate\\nof 18, BUN of 46, creatinine of 2.1 and glucose of 217.  CK\\nwas 555, calcium was 9.0 and magnesium was 1.6.   Arterial\\nblood gases showed a pH of 7.33, a pCO2 of 29 and a pO2 of\\n90.\\n\\nELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The patient's electrocardiogram on\\n[**2172-10-12**] showed him to be in sinus rhythm at 60\\nwith a prolonged P-R interval, a normal P wave and a QRS axis\\nof -60 to -90.  He also had a right bundle branch block with\\na left anterior hemiblock.  He had Q waves noted in leads III\\nand aVF.  He also had some premature ventricular\\ncontractions.  There were T wave inversions in leads V1 to\\nV4, which appeared unchanged from his electrocardiogram from\\n[**2172-7-1**].\\n\\nRADIOLOGY DATA:  The patient's chest x-ray showed significant\\npulmonary vascular redistribution cephalad.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Following cardiac catheterization, the\\npatient was continued on Plavix and received aggressive\\ndiuresis for his elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.\\nOn [**2172-10-15**], the patient was noted to have\\ncontinued runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and an\\nechocardiogram was done, which showed the patient to have a\\nmoderately depressed left ventricular function with 1+ aortic\\ninsufficiency, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid\\nregurgitation.  He also was noted to have inferior and\\ninferoseptal hypokinesis.  The pulmonary artery catheter was\\nremoved along with the introducer on that day.\\n\\nOn [**2172-10-16**], the patient was noted to be in atrial\\nbigeminy in the morning and also continued to have short runs\\nof nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of three to four\\nbeats.  The patient continued with his intravenous diuresis\\nwith 80 mg of Lasix q.d. and was subsequently transferred to\\nthe floor.  On [**2172-10-17**], the electrophysiology\\ndepartment was informally consulted and the patient's\\nmetoprolol dose was increased.  The patient's rhythm\\ncontinued to be monitored.\\n\\nOn [**2172-10-19**], the patient was in stable condition\\nwith adequate diuresis.  His nonsustained ventricular\\ntachycardia continued to improve and the patient continued to\\nshow no further episodes of nonsustained ventricular\\ntachycardia.\\n\\nThe patient was discharged home on [**2172-10-19**] in\\nstable condition.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\nPlavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.\\nEnteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\\nLipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.\\nMetoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. q.d.\\nEnalapril 10 mg p.o. q.d.\\nAmlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.\\nLasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.\\nColace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\nNitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual every five minutes p.r.n.\\ntimes three.\\nProtonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.\\n\\nFOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to follow up with his\\nprimary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], at [**Hospital3 **] in the\\nupcoming week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2053**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2052**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) **]\\n\\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 26201**]\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:  [**2172-10-20**]  14:46\\nT:  [**2172-10-20**]  14:59\\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 36831**]\\n\"\n",

Occasional alcohol.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of breast cancer.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.6, blood\\npressure 110/50, heart rate 66, respirating at 12, 95% on\\nroom air.  In general, pleasant, no acute distress.  HEENT:\\nAnicteric.  Oropharynx is clear.  Pupils equal, round,\\nreactive to light.  Extraocular muscles intact.

No\\nevidence of pulmonary consolidation.\\n\\nCT head also done in the Emergency Department showed no\\nevidence of metastatic disease.\\n\\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  49-year-old female with\\nmetastatic breast cancer to lungs, liver, and bone apparently\\non Xeloda and Herceptin being admitted for superior vena cava\\nsyndrome secondary to thrombus.\\n\\n1.  Superior vena cava clot:  The patient was noted to have a\\n3 cm clot in her superior vena cava likely related to her\\nPort-A-Cath which was involved with the clot, according to\\nRadiology secondary report.  The patient was immediately\\nplaced on a Heparin drip, and consideration for thrombectomy\\nversus other Interventional Radiology procedures was\\nconsidered.\\n\\nGiven the patient's significant symptoms of dyspnea as well\\nas facial swelling, she was started on a TPA infusion for a\\ntotal of 24 hours.  The TPA infusion was per an\\nInterventional Radiology protocol, and the patient was\\nmonitored in the Intensive Care Unit during this infusion\\nperiod.  The patient was monitored for signs of bleeding.\\n\\nDuring the infusion the patient's Heparin drip was decreased,\\nand she was closely monitored for neurologic, bleeding, or\\nother signs of bleeding.  The TPA was infused through her\\nPort-A-Cath.  The infusion was 1 mg per hour times eight\\nhours then 0.5 mg per hour times 16 hours.\\n\\n[**Name (NI) **] PT, INR, fibrinogen, platelets, and hematocrits\\nwere followed during this infusion.  If her fibrinogen was\\nless than 150, her TPA dose would be decreased by half, and\\nif it was less than 100 her TPA would be discontinued\\ncompletely.  The patient's fibrinogen remained stable\\nthroughout, and her TPA was tolerated well.\\n\\nThe repeat CTA showed complete clearance of clot along wall\\nof the superior vena cava and a very small filling defect.\\nThere was a fibrin sheath or residual clot--it was\\nunclear--along the terminal portion of the Port-A-Cath just\\nabove tip.\\n\\nGiven the small filling defect and likely fibrin sheath on\\nthe Port-A-Cath, further intervention was considered with\\nInterventional Radiology as well as Surgery.  The\\nconsideration included balloon angioplasty and/or catheter\\nstripping through Interventional Radiology versus a surgical\\nadvancement of the catheter tip for improved placement.\\nThere was thought that the current catheter placement was\\nlikely causing some vessel wall injury which led to the clot\\nformation.\\n\\nA final decision was made to have the patient fully\\nanticoagulated on Coumadin for a goal INR of between 2 and 3.\\nAfter approximately one month of full anticoagulation, Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], who is the Surgical consult, agreed to advance the\\ncatheter into the right atrium to avoid further vessel injury\\nand likely further clot formation.  A total of six months of\\nanticoagulation was recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the\\ninterventional radiologists.\\n\\nIn addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended to avoid sclerosing\\nagents to be used in the Port-A-Cath, which may cause\\nadditional vessel wall injury and possible clot formation.\\n\\nThe patient remained in hospital until her INR became\\ntherapeutic on Coumadin while on her Heparin drip until her\\nINR was between 2 and 3.  She received two days of 10 mg of\\nCoumadin and was transitioned to 5 mg q. day as an\\noutpatient.  She will have an INR checked in one day upon\\ndischarge and will be adjusted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and then again in\\ntwo days, in which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] will adjust her Coumadin\\ndosing.\\n\\n2.  Oncology:  The patient received two Herceptin treatments\\nwhile in hospital, continuing with her weekly Herceptin,\\nwithout any complications.  She was also continued on her\\ndaily Xeloda treatment and her Femara.  The patient's blood\\ncounts were followed closely without any evidence of\\nneutropenia or anemia.\\n\\nThe patient had an MRI of her pelvis done to evaluate her\\npersistent hip pain.  The MRI results were pending upon her\\ndischarge.  The patient's pain was fairly well controlled\\nwith her Fentanyl patch and p.r.n. Tylenol.\\n\\nThe patient received Xeloda 1000 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 1500 mg\\np.o. q. p.m. for 14 days.  She is on a two-week on and\\none-week off schedule.\\n\\n3.  Code status:  Patient preferred not to have heroic\\nmeasures done and instructed the house status to make her Do\\nNot Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate, as well as she provided a\\nhealth care proxy form, which is her husband, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].\\n\\nDISPOSITION:  To home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good status post TPA infusion and\\ntherapeutic INR of 2.2 upon discharge.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1.  Superior vena cava clot with associated superior vena\\ncava syndrome.\\n2.  Metastatic breast carcinoma.\\n3.  Anxiety.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.  Fentanyl patch 100 mcg q. 72 hours.\\n2.  Lorazepam 1 mg q. h.s. as needed.\\n3.  Effexor 75 mg q. day.\\n4.  Protonix 40 mg q. day.\\n5.  Colace 100 b.i.d.\\n6.  Senna, one tab, q. day.\\n7.  Coumadin 5 mg q. h.s. to be adjusted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].\\n\\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:\\n1.  Outpatient laboratory work:  Patient is to have her INR\\nchecked on [**2115-1-4**] and fax results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at\\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 22294**].  She is also to have her INR checked during the\\nweekend of [**2115-1-5**] and to have Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] paged with the\\nresults and given her pager number.\\n2.  She is to have a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\\nin approximately four to six weeks, and they are to call her\\nto set up that appointment.  She was also given the number to\\nset up that appointment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 16520**]\\n\\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3480**]\\n\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:  [**2115-1-3**]  15:34\\nT:  [**2115-1-3**]  20:35\\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 22295**]\\n\"\n",

The patient's fibrinogen remained stable\\nthroughout, and her TPA was tolerated well.\\n\\nThe repeat CTA showed complete clearance of clot along wall\\nof the superior vena cava and a very small filling defect.\\nThere was a fibrin sheath or residual clot--it was\\nunclear--along the terminal portion of the Port-A-Cath just\\nabove tip.\\n\\nGiven the small filling defect and likely fibrin sheath on\\nthe Port-A-Cath, further intervention was considered with\\nInterventional Radiology as well as Surgery.  The\\nconsideration included balloon angioplasty and/or catheter\\nstripping through Interventional Radiology versus a surgical\\nadvancement of the catheter tip for improved placement.\\nThere was thought that the current catheter placement was\\nlikely causing some vessel wall injury which led to the clot\\nformation.\\n\\nA final decision was made to have the patient fully\\nanticoagulated on Coumadin for a goal INR of between 2 and 3.\\nAfter approximately one month of full anticoagulation, Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **], who is the Surgical consult, agreed to advance the\\ncatheter into the right atrium to avoid further vessel injury\\nand likely further clot formation.  A total of six months of\\nanticoagulation was recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the\\ninterventional radiologists.\\n\\nIn addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended to avoid sclerosing\\nagents to be used in the Port-A-Cath, which may cause\\nadditional vessel wall injury and possible clot formation.\\n\\nThe patient remained in hospital until her INR became\\ntherapeutic on Coumadin while on her Heparin drip until her\\nINR was between 2 and 3.  She received two days of 10 mg of\\nCoumadin and was transitioned to 5 mg q. day as an\\noutpatient.  She will have an INR checked in one day upon\\ndischarge and will be adjusted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and then again in\\ntwo days, in which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] will adjust her Coumadin\\ndosing.\\n\\n2.  Oncology:  The patient received two Herceptin treatments\\nwhile in hospital, continuing with her weekly Herceptin,\\nwithout any complications.  She was also continued on her\\ndaily Xeloda treatment and her Femara.  The patient's blood\\ncounts were followed closely without any evidence of\\nneutropenia or anemia.\\n\\nThe patient had an MRI of her pelvis done to evaluate her\\npersistent hip pain.  The MRI results were pending upon her\\ndischarge.  The patient's pain was fairly well controlled\\nwith her Fentanyl patch and p.r.n. Tylenol.\\n\\nThe patient received Xeloda 1000 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 1500 mg\\np.o. q. p.m. for 14 days.  She is on a two-week on and\\none-week off schedule.\\n\\n3.  Code status:  Patient preferred not to have heroic\\nmeasures done and instructed the house status to make her Do\\nNot Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate, as well as she provided a\\nhealth care proxy form, which is her husband, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].\\n\\nDISPOSITION:  To home.\\n\\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good status post TPA infusion and\\ntherapeutic INR of 2.2 upon discharge.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\\n1.

This induction was carried\\nout to accommodate the patient's\\nplanned chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer diagnosed at\\n22wks, s/p L mastectomy and L axillary dissection, and\\nchemotherapy x2 cycles ([**2177-6-12**] and [**2177-7-3**]). On arrival, the\\npatient had a cervical exam that was unfavorable and was given 1\\ndose of Pitocin. Following this the patient had a favorable\\ncervix and was started on Pitocin. Over the course of the day,\\nshe progressed well to full dilation and vaginally delivered a\\nlive born girl that was transferred to the NICU for further\\nevaluation. At the time of the delivery, the patient had a blood\\nloss of 450 cc and a small periurethral lac that was repaired\\nwith a 4-0 Vicryl. Good hemostasis was obtained.\\n\\n15 minutes following delivery, the patient had further vaginal\\nbleeding. This was estimated to be approximately 300 cc. This\\nwas associated with uterine atony. On exam, the uterus was found\\nto be atonic and a large amount of clot was found in the lower\\nuterine segment. The tone improved with bimanual massage as well\\nas 1 dose of Methergine and 40 units of Pitocin. At this point\\nin time, the patient was typed and screened and remained on\\nlabor and delivery for further monitoring. 15 minutes later, the\\npatient had a another episode of the uterine to atony that\\nresulted in a gush of blood approximately 100 cc in volume. At\\nthis time, a transabdominal ultrasound was performed which\\nrevealed a poorly defined endometrial stripe. The uterus was\\nfound to be atonic and improved with massage. In light of the\\npersistence of this postpartum hemorrhage with intermittent\\natony, the patient was recommended for dilation and curettage as\\nwell as exam under anesthesia to rule out retained products of\\nconception. The details of the operative procedure are found in\\nthe operative report elsewhere.\\n\\nDuring the procedure, as the patient continued to have some\\nuterine atony, she was given a dose of Methergine and 2 doses of\\nHemabate. Following suction, the external genitalia was\\ninspected and the first degree periurethral laceration appeared\\nintact. There was a first degree laceration in the posterior\\nfourchette that was repaired with 3-0 chromic in the usual\\nfashion. Good hemostasis was obtained. Following this procedure,\\nas the patient continued to have a small amount of bleeding, she\\nreceived a further dose of 1000 mcg of Cytotec.\\n\\nHaving exhausted medical management of postpartum hemorrhage\\noptions, an emergent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral\\nsalpingo-oophorectomy was performed to further control bleeding.\\n Blood products infused at the time of surgery were 7units PRBC,\\n1 unit PLT, 2 FFPs, 1unit cryo.  The details of this procedure\\nis found in detail in the operative report elsewhere.  The pt\\nremained intubated and was transferred to the intensive care\\nunit for management on POD#0.\\n\\nPOD#0, pt was noted to have new onset diplopia/nystagmus.  MRI\\nwas ordered and was negative for stroke/brainstem injury.\\nDiplopia/nystagmus resolved spontaneously.  Given demand\\nischemia in setting of intraoperative tachycardia, EKG was done\\nand cardiac enzymes were cycled.  CK and troponin were found\\nelevated.  Pt was weaned off vent, and hypotension, likely\\nsecondary to PPH, resolved with 3units of additional PRBC in the\\nICU over POD#0-2.  Pt was transferred to the floor on POD#2.\\n\\nPt continued to do well without complications on the floor with\\nroutine postop/postpartum care.  On POD#5, given elevated\\nCK/troponin intraop, pt underwent echo, which was all within\\nnormal limits.  Details of the echo results are available in the\\necho report.\\n\\nPt was discharged home in stable condition on POD#5.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nPNV\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

This induction was carried\\nout to accommodate the patient's\\nplanned chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer diagnosed at\\n22wks, s/p L mastectomy and L axillary dissection, and\\nchemotherapy x2 cycles ([**2177-6-12**] and [**2177-7-3**]). On arrival, the\\npatient had a cervical exam that was unfavorable and was given 1\\ndose of Pitocin. Following this the patient had a favorable\\ncervix and was started on Pitocin. Over the course of the day,\\nshe progressed well to full dilation and vaginally delivered a\\nlive born girl that was transferred to the NICU for further\\nevaluation. At the time of the delivery, the patient had a blood\\nloss of 450 cc and a small periurethral lac that was repaired\\nwith a 4-0 Vicryl. Good hemostasis was obtained.\\n\\n15 minutes following delivery, the patient had further vaginal\\nbleeding. This was estimated to be approximately 300 cc. This\\nwas associated with uterine atony. On exam, the uterus was found\\nto be atonic and a large amount of clot was found in the lower\\nuterine segment. The tone improved with bimanual massage as well\\nas 1 dose of Methergine and 40 units of Pitocin. At this point\\nin time, the patient was typed and screened and remained on\\nlabor and delivery for further monitoring. 15 minutes later, the\\npatient had a another episode of the uterine to atony that\\nresulted in a gush of blood approximately 100 cc in volume. At\\nthis time, a transabdominal ultrasound was performed which\\nrevealed a poorly defined endometrial stripe. The uterus was\\nfound to be atonic and improved with massage. In light of the\\npersistence of this postpartum hemorrhage with intermittent\\natony, the patient was recommended for dilation and curettage as\\nwell as exam under anesthesia to rule out retained products of\\nconception. The details of the operative procedure are found in\\nthe operative report elsewhere.\\n\\nDuring the procedure, as the patient continued to have some\\nuterine atony, she was given a dose of Methergine and 2 doses of\\nHemabate. Following suction, the external genitalia was\\ninspected and the first degree periurethral laceration appeared\\nintact. There was a first degree laceration in the posterior\\nfourchette that was repaired with 3-0 chromic in the usual\\nfashion. Good hemostasis was obtained. Following this procedure,\\nas the patient continued to have a small amount of bleeding, she\\nreceived a further dose of 1000 mcg of Cytotec.\\n\\nHaving exhausted medical management of postpartum hemorrhage\\noptions, an emergent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral\\nsalpingo-oophorectomy was performed to further control bleeding.\\n Blood products infused at the time of surgery were 7units PRBC,\\n1 unit PLT, 2 FFPs, 1unit cryo.  The details of this procedure\\nis found in detail in the operative report elsewhere.  The pt\\nremained intubated and was transferred to the intensive care\\nunit for management on POD#0.\\n\\nPOD#0, pt was noted to have new onset diplopia/nystagmus.  MRI\\nwas ordered and was negative for stroke/brainstem injury.\\nDiplopia/nystagmus resolved spontaneously.  Given demand\\nischemia in setting of intraoperative tachycardia, EKG was done\\nand cardiac enzymes were cycled.  CK and troponin were found\\nelevated.  Pt was weaned off vent, and hypotension, likely\\nsecondary to PPH, resolved with 3units of additional PRBC in the\\nICU over POD#0-2.  Pt was transferred to the floor on POD#2.\\n\\nPt continued to do well without complications on the floor with\\nroutine postop/postpartum care.  On POD#5, given elevated\\nCK/troponin intraop, pt underwent echo, which was all within\\nnormal limits.  Details of the echo results are available in the\\necho report.\\n\\nPt was discharged home in stable condition on POD#5.\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nPNV\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

By the day of\\ndischarge, the patient was on Fentanyl patch 125 mcg.\\nBreakthrough pain was initially managed by Dilaudid and then\\nlater changed to morphine sulfate.  The patient was requiring\\nanywhere from 2 mg to 4 mg as needed.  The patient's\\nrequirement for breakthrough pain was more than three times\\nper day.  The Fentanyl patch should be titrated up\\naccordingly.\\n\\nThe patient was also maintained on Decadron.  Initially, she\\nwas on a Decadron taper; however, the patient's mental status\\nbegan to decline.  Therefore, the patient was then increased\\nto 8 mg intravenously q.8h. of Decadron.  The patient was to\\nbe maintained on this dose of Decadron without taper from\\nthis point on.  The patient will also need to be continued on\\nKeppra for the purpose of seizure prophylaxis.  Additionally,\\nshe was maintained on Protonix and an insulin sliding-scale\\nwith very good glycemic control.\\n\\nThroughout her hospitalization, the patient had problems\\ntaking by mouth medications.  Therefore, necessary\\nmedications were maintained in intravenous form.\\n\\nThe patient tolerated a regular diet.  Her electrolytes were\\nfollowed closely and repleted as needed.  The patient was\\nalso maintained on a bowel regimen.  The patient's hematocrit\\nslowly trended down toward 24.7 on the day prior to\\ndischarge, and she was transfused one unit of packed red\\nblood cells.  Additionally, she experienced mild\\nthrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 144; which, by the\\nday of discharge, had increased to 156.  It was felt this\\ncould be secondary to Bactrim which she had been on for\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.  Therefore, the\\nBactrim was discontinued.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient's medications on\\ndischarge included)\\n 1.  Fentanyl patch 125 mcg transdermally q.72h.\\n 2.  Morphine sulfate 2 mg to 10 mg intravenously q.4h. as\\nneeded.\\n 3.  Dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously q.8h.\\n 4.  Sliding-scale.\\n 5.  Zofran 4 mg intravenously q.6h. as needed.\\n 6.  Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.\\n 7.  Keppra 500 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 8.  Docusate 100 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 9.  Bisacodyl 10 mg by mouth/per rectum once per day as\\nneeded.\\n10.  Nystatin swish-and-swallow.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's Condition on discharge\\nwas fair.

By the day of\\ndischarge, the patient was on Fentanyl patch 125 mcg.\\nBreakthrough pain was initially managed by Dilaudid and then\\nlater changed to morphine sulfate.  The patient was requiring\\nanywhere from 2 mg to 4 mg as needed.  The patient's\\nrequirement for breakthrough pain was more than three times\\nper day.  The Fentanyl patch should be titrated up\\naccordingly.\\n\\nThe patient was also maintained on Decadron.  Initially, she\\nwas on a Decadron taper; however, the patient's mental status\\nbegan to decline.  Therefore, the patient was then increased\\nto 8 mg intravenously q.8h. of Decadron.  The patient was to\\nbe maintained on this dose of Decadron without taper from\\nthis point on.  The patient will also need to be continued on\\nKeppra for the purpose of seizure prophylaxis.  Additionally,\\nshe was maintained on Protonix and an insulin sliding-scale\\nwith very good glycemic control.\\n\\nThroughout her hospitalization, the patient had problems\\ntaking by mouth medications.  Therefore, necessary\\nmedications were maintained in intravenous form.\\n\\nThe patient tolerated a regular diet.  Her electrolytes were\\nfollowed closely and repleted as needed.  The patient was\\nalso maintained on a bowel regimen.  The patient's hematocrit\\nslowly trended down toward 24.7 on the day prior to\\ndischarge, and she was transfused one unit of packed red\\nblood cells.  Additionally, she experienced mild\\nthrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 144; which, by the\\nday of discharge, had increased to 156.  It was felt this\\ncould be secondary to Bactrim which she had been on for\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis.  Therefore, the\\nBactrim was discontinued.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient's medications on\\ndischarge included)\\n 1.  Fentanyl patch 125 mcg transdermally q.72h.\\n 2.  Morphine sulfate 2 mg to 10 mg intravenously q.4h. as\\nneeded.\\n 3.  Dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously q.8h.\\n 4.  Sliding-scale.\\n 5.  Zofran 4 mg intravenously q.6h. as needed.\\n 6.  Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.\\n 7.  Keppra 500 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 8.  Docusate 100 mg by mouth twice per day.\\n 9.  Bisacodyl 10 mg by mouth/per rectum once per day as\\nneeded.\\n10.  Nystatin swish-and-swallow.\\n\\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's Condition on discharge\\nwas fair.  The patient was stable on room air and able to\\nambulate.  Mostly disoriented but communicative.\\n\\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to\\n[**Hospital3 14**] today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2463**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 2464**]\\n\\nDictated By:[**MD Number(1) 16782**]\\n\\nMEDQUIST36\\n\\nD:  [**2121-10-31**]  07:43\\nT:  [**2121-10-31**]  09:04\\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 16783**]\\n\"\n",
